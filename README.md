VanillaJS SPA Practice
This is just a simple Single Paged Application to practice SPA routing in pure JS

Note:
This application uses Browser-Sync as a server, and uses the --single flag to force-serve index.html for links that don't exist.
This is important because in SPAs, there is only index.html, if user tries to access other pages without doing this, will return 404 not found


To Run: 
1. clone the repository
2. do npm install
3. do npm start
* npm start works because i've configured "npm start" to run browser sync through the package.json file
